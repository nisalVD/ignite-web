            <h2>Expectations for Ignite volunteers</h2>
            <br></br>            
            <p>Ignite is committed to the development of people. This includes you, the people you work with and the young people in your care. As part of our care for people, this code is designed to ensure safe and correct conduct is followed to ignite the potential in young people. </p>
            <br></br>
            <ol>
                <li>All volunteers are required to fulfill the correct process for volunteers before acting out duties. This includes an interview, submission of Working with Childrens Check, volunteer form and reference checks.</li>
            <br></br>                
                <li>Upholding Ignites mission, vision and values and conducting yourself at all times in a way that could not be interpreted as disparaging to these.</li>
            <br></br>                
                <li>Seeking to honour all team members including staff, interns, volunteers, young people and their families through appropriate and respectful relationships. This includes using non threatening behavior and non offensive language.</li>
            <br></br>                
                <li>Be a team player. You are not the young persons super hero. You are not their counselor. Work together to decide best course of action to respond to young persons need. </li>
            <br></br>                
                <li>One on one contact with a young person must be in vision of others at all times. Your supervisor should be made aware of any one on one contact with a young person in or outside a program that is longer than 5 minutes (as part of working together). </li>

                <li>Physical contact with young people must be minimal and above reproach. 
                </li>
                <br></br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Avoid hugging. If a young person initiates a hug and you feel it is appropriate, keep it very short. You do not have to accept the hug if you feel it is inappropriate. </li>
                        <br></br>
                        <li>High fives are appropriate and a good way to affirm a young person craving physical touch.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br></br>
                <li>Any contact with young people part of Ignite must be above reproach. When contact is made outside the program it is paramount that the following points are adhered to. </li>
