                <li>Ignite is passionate about building into all leaders. Each leader is encouraged to engage in a faith community and/or a mentor relationship for personal growth. All volunteers are expected to carry out some relevant training through out the year. </li>
            <br></br>
                <li>Ignite knows leaders can offer a variety of talents and resources. Leadership is seen to be anything that influence a young person, therefore driving a car is seen as an opportunity to lead, not just in ‘how’ you drive but the conversation and relationships that are built during this time. Please don’t ever underestimate your influence on a young person no matter how small you feel your input is. </li>
